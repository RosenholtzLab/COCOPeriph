List of Notebooks:
- SewMongrelExperiment.ipynb  Use this to create pseudofoveated images by 'sewing' image transforms at increasing eccentricities together. This notebook specifically creates the pseudofoveated images used in the human and machine psychophysics experiments. You can re-create these pseudofoveated images with this notebook OR you can download pre-generated ones (here)[https://data.csail.mit.edu/coco_periph/]
